## Setup:

First you'll want to obtain your **Blockclock's IP** address as well as a **Braiins Auth Token**.

*Also note that the computer on which you run this script will have to be on the same network as the Blockclock.*

### Getting your Blockclock IP address & setup:

This assume's that you have already setup your Blockclock Mini. 

If you need your Blockclock's IP, press on the second button from the top right side of the Blockclock. You'll see an IP address, likely in the 5th square.

NOTE: You'll need to set your Blockclock to **manual**. To do so enter your Blockclock's IP address in the URL bar of a browser.

You now have access to your Blockclock's settings page. On the **Display Page**, go down to **Display Preferences**, set **Screen Update Rate** to **Manual**.

That is all! 

### Getting your Braiins Auth Token:

Login here:
https://pool.braiins.com/login

1. Click on the icon on the right of your username in the top right corner.
2. Click on **Devices**
3. Click on **Access Profiles**
4. Click on **Create New**
5. Add a username. **Access Permissions** can be set to **read-only**. 
   Check-off **Allow access to web APIs**, click **Generate new token** and copy that **Auth Token**. 
   Finally, click on **Create Access Profile**.

**Keep that IP address and Auth Token handy. You'll be asked to enter those on startup**

## Installation

The binary for braiin clock is... believe it or not, braiin_clock. 
Once installed you'll enter **braiin_clock** in your terminal window to run it. 

Currently the only way to install the binary is with cargo. 

First install the rust toolchain - If youâ€™re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:

```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh``` 

For Windows users visit: https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html#other-ways-to-install-rustup

You'll need to download and run the rustup-init executable. 

Once cargo has been installed you're ready to download the binary, run the following: 

```cargo install braiin_clock```

## Running the binary

To run the program enter the following in a terminal window: ```braiin_clock```

The program will start. 

*If this command does not work make sure the ```.cargo/``` directory is on your Path.*

## How to use

You'll be asked to enter you Braiins API Token and your Blockclock's IP address.
If you enter this incorrectly or need to change it, just quit (CTRL+C) the program and restart it.

Follow the instructions --> Select the tags you want to display and press "q" after you've selected your desired tags. Select your desired refresh rate (5 minutes is best for me) and press enter.
If you want to change any of these settings you'll want to press CTRL+C to exit the program and start over.

The Blockclock will display the tags in the selected order, continuously, until you exit the program, close the terminal or shutdown your computer. 

This is a work in progress to help me learn Rust and Bitcoin so there may be bugs. Please open an issue if you run into any or if you'd like to see new features. Thank you :D
