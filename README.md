## Setup:

First you'll want to obtain your **Blockclock's IP** address as well as a **Braiins Auth Token**.

### Getting your Blockclock IP address:

This assume's that you have already setup your Blockclock Mini. 

If you need your Blockclock's IP, press on the second button from the top on the right side of the Blockclock. You'll see an IP address, likely in the 5th square.

We'll need to set your blockclock to manual in order to send it GET requests. Enter your clock's IP in a browser

You now have access to your Blockclock's settings page. On the **Display Page**, go down to **Display Preferences**, set **Screen Update Rate** to **Manual**.

That is all! 

### Getting your Braiins Auth Token:

   Finally, click on **Create Access Profile**.

**Keep that IP address and Auth Token handy. You'll be asked to enter those on startup**
